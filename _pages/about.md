I'm passionate about the interdependence between the health of the environment and the health of humans. I like to work on statistical methods driven by questions in environmental health and science, including spatial statistics, Bayesian disease mapping, user-focused statistical methods for environmental/public health, and reproducible research. I am currently working with Drs. Brent Coull and Rachel Nethery on model development for small-area spatial disease analysis. 

I hold a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Colorado School of Mines, where I conducted research on sleep and circadian rhythms and automated sensitivity analysis for dynamical systems. This work has led me to multiple conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications, including a first-author article on sex differences in adolescent circadian timing. 

In my free time, I love anything outdoors but especially hiking/backpacking, mountain biking, and climbing. I also practice yoga and I'm a huge book worm!

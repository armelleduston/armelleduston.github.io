Circadian rhythms, intrinsic 24-h cycles that drive rhythmic changes
in behavior and physiology, are important for normal physiology and health. Previous work in adults has identified sex differences in circadian rhythms of melatonin, temperature, and the intrinsic period of the human circadian timing system. However, less is known about sex differences in circadian rhythms at other developmental stages. To address this gap, we considered a secondary analysis of sleep and circadian data from two studies involving adolescent participants during the academic year: (n = 32, 15 females). We collected 1 week of in-home actigraphy data to calculate sleep-wake parameters and in-laboratory salivary melatonin data collection in dim-light conditions was used to compute dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) and offset (DLMOff) using a threshold of 4 pg/mL. We found that DLMO was an average of 96 min earlier, the time between DLMO and bedtime was an average of 56 min greater, and the biological night (time between DLMO and DLMOff) was 60 min longer in females compared to males, even though bedtimes and waketimes were not statistically different between the groups. In addition, after accounting for differences in bedtime, sex was still a significant predictor of DLMO. Conversely, no evidence was found indicating a difference in DLMOff or the phase angle between DLMOff and waketime by sex. These findings suggest that sex differences in circadian rhythms are present in adolescents and may have implications for circadian health during this important developmental period.
